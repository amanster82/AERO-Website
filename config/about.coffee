        # What We Do
        UVic AERO is a group of approximately 40 engineering students who build Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS's), we compete annually in the Unmanned Systems Canada Student competition.

         The competition requires each team to build a UAS to survey a simulated disaster zone and give a detailed report of the damaged area. AERO achieved 3rd place in 2014 and 2nd place in 2015.

          AERO aims to give students experience working in the quickly growing industry of aerial robotics. Members learn to apply their skills as they design and create software, circuit boards, and airframes while working in a large team with students from many different disciplines.

        # Objectives
        Aero engages in activities that help us fulfill our mission objectives:


        1. Engage the community in ways that help facilitate the growth of knowledge and interest in the fields of engineering and aeronautics.
        2. Provide university students with a chance to apply the theory they learn in class by competing in UAV competitions that score on design and performance.
        3. Win an unmanned aircraft student competition.


        To help fulfill our outreach goal, we provide skill development workshops for students of all ages, at no cost to the participant. Some of these workshops include soldering, circuit design, and 3D modelling to name a few. With the cooperation of groups like Science Venture, we're able to educate youth in the various aspects of aeronautics and engineering. Through the organization of tours and information sessions, we're able to spark the interest of potential future engineers.

        We compete anually in competitions which push us to design, fabricate, test and integration many complex systems in one UAV. This time intensive process allows us to apply our learnings to a real world problem. A UAV contains many mechanical, electrical and software systems that we design from the ground up, implement and test. Outside of the creation of the UAV itself, we prepare techincal reports and journal papers that outline our design decisions and methods.

            # Competitions
            We compete in competitions for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV's) with applications to the agricultural, oil & gas, and mining industry.

            ## Unmanned Systems Canada
            Typically comprised of an aerial survey of a simulated disaster. Teams identify potential hazards, chemical spills, damaged vehicles and structures, and people using an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle.

            We last attended in 2015 and sent seven members to Alma, Quebec, April 30th to May 4th to compete against 13 Canadian Universities. We placed 2nd and identified 38 objects of interest with multiple passes of the area in 30 minutes of flight time.
