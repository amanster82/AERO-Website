    # Levels of Sponsorship

    Our team requires support to purchase airfare, rent hotel rooms, design and print team clothing and banners. We often pay these through cash sponsorship from individuals or companies. If your business provides one of these items as a service you may also donate them to be counted as a cash sponsorship. We currently offer three levels of advertisement, proportional to the size of the sponsorship; they are listed in the table below:

    Our team also requires equipment and off-the-shelf components to complete the unmanned system and test it. Similar to cash sponsorship, support through equipment and hardware sponsorship also have corresponding levels or advertisement as part of our thank you.

    Acknowledgement receipts are provided for all sponsorship contributions.

    If you're interested in discussing how you can support our team, please [contact us](/contact).
