    description:"""With a complex system such as a UAV, you need to bring minds of many displines together in order to bring a design to life. Although each member of our team comes from a particular faculty/disipline, our responsibilities are not tired to our existing knowledge. Members are encouraged to work on the systems that interest them, to push their boundaries and learn something new. Below, broken up by field, are the various tasks and activities members can expect to partake in.

        name: "Aeronautical Engineering"
        description: "The aeronautical engineering component of the team involves the design and construction of the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). Aircraft designs are created using CAD software and modelled using Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD). Construction of the airframe involves CNC milling and custom molding from Kevlar and carbon fiber. Further aeronautical engineering development of the UAV involves flight testing and installation of control surfaces and motors for flight."
    ,
        name: "Mechanical Engineering"
        description: "The mechanical engineering component of the team involves the development of all dedicated mechanical systems needed to support the UAV. These projects involve the antenna tracker, which rotates an antenna to always point at the plane and maintain high quality communications; the camera gimbal, which ensures that an on-board camera can be oriented in any desired position regardless of the orientation of the aircraft; and the launcher, which allows for flight take-off of the relatively large UAV."
        meetingTime: "Thursdays at 7pm"
    ,
        name:"Electrical Engineering"
        description: "Members working on the electrical aspects of the plane deal with the sensors, communications, and internal wiring of the plane. Depending on the requirements of the competition, this could include infrared imaging, long-range communications, and advanced printed circuit board (PCB) design."
    ,
        name: "Embedded Systems"
        description: "Members with closely with the Electrical Engineering and Software Engineering students to develop the integrated systems required both in the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and the ground control station (GCS). Members get the opportunity to design, prototype, fabricate and test various electrical control hardware components, and work with the software team to program the software for their operation."
        confluence: "http://confluence.uvicaero.com/display/ET/Embedded+Team"
        meetingTime: "Thursdays at 6:30"
        location: "ECS 250"
    ,
        name: "Software Engineering"
        description: "The goal of the competitions is to make the aircraft as autonomous as possible, so a comprehensive autopilot system is necessary. The software has to deal with sensor input, such as reading GPS receivers, gyroscopes, and accelerometers to adjust the course of the plane, and processing images to pick out targets of interest. Finally, the software is responsible for coordinating all other elements of the plane and interaction with the ground control station (GCS). This information is used by the flight team to analysis targets, survey images and mission details."
    ,
        name: "Civil and Biomedical Engineering"
        description: "Almost all of the skills that students develop by being a contributing member of the UVic Aero team are useful to all disciplines of engineering. To be a successful modern engineer one must draw from multidisciplinary knowledge. Biomedical draws heavily from Mechanical and Electrical, while Civil and Mechanical are relatively analogous (especially in the first three years). There will always be a place on the Aero team for someone who is interested and motivated."
    ,
        name: "Business and Marketing"
        description: "Aero couldn't run at all without support such as corporate sponsorship and donors. Members approach companies (see the right sidebar for some examples) to try to secure sponsorship, and work on getting our team known through our website and by attending various UVic and community events. There are also plenty of opportunities to get some experience managing both small and large teams."
