    # How can I help?
    ## If you are a post-secondary student in the area, you can join us for any of the discipline meetings listed below. As a member you are encouraged to work on the systems that interest you and not necessairily the one that corresponds to your discipline.
    ## Also, dont be shy or feel intimidated. We enjoy helping individuals of all skill levels develop the same passion for aeronautics that we have.

    ### Note: If you have any trouble with the confluence links below please visit [our registration page](http://jira.uvicaero.com/secure/Signup!default.jspa) to sign up and see the pages.

        name: "Aeronautical Engineering"
        description: "Closely affiliated with the organizationâ€™s mechanical division, the aeronautical team is primarily concerned with the design, manufacture, and assembly of the system airframe. Internal structuring and logistical integration of payload subsystems are fundamental focuses. From computational fluid dynamics and airfoil analysis, to SolidWorks CAD, composite layups, and component machining, the aeronautical team ensures the UAS is capable of its aerial requirements. As such, flight testing, in-field adjustment, and post-operation maintenance/repair are supplementary concerns"

        name: "Mechanical Engineering"
        description: "The mechanical engineering component of the team involves the development of all dedicated mechanical systems needed to support the UAV. These projects involve the antenna tracker, which rotates an antenna to always point at the plane and maintain high quality communications; the camera gimbal, which ensures that an on-board camera can be oriented in any desired position regardless of the orientation of the aircraft; and the launcher, which allows for flight take-off of the relatively large UAV."

        name:"Electrical Engineering"
        description: "The Electrical team designs and builds the electrical circuits which control and interface all of AEROs systems. We get to fully design some of our systems such as the Camera Gimbal and Antenna Tracker. We also provide interfaces for systems that are too complex for us to design, for now, such as the Autopilot Carrier and Radio Carrier Boards."

        description: "Members with closely with the Electrical Engineering and Software Engineering students to develop the integrated systems required both in the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and the ground control station (GCS). Members get the opportunity to design, prototype, fabricate and test various electrical control hardware components, and work with the software team to program the software for their operation."

        name: "Software Engineering"
        description: "The goal of the competitions is to make the aircraft as autonomous as possible, so a comprehensive autopilot system is necessary. The software has to deal with sensor input, such as reading GPS receivers, gyroscopes, and accelerometers to adjust the course of the plane, and processing images to pick out targets of interest. Finally, the software is responsible for coordinating all other elements of the plane and interaction with the ground control station (GCS). This information is used by the flight team to analysis targets, survey images and mission details."

        #        description: "Almost all of the skills that students develop by being a contributing member of the UVic Aero team are useful to all disciplines of engineering. To be a successful modern engineer one must draw from multidisciplinary knowledge. Biomedical draws heavily from Mechanical and Electrical, while Civil and Mechanical are relatively analogous (especially in the first three years). There will always be a place on the Aero team for someone who is interested and motivated."

        #        description: "Aero couldn't run at all without support such as corporate sponsorship and donors. Members approach companies (see the right sidebar for some examples) to try to secure sponsorship, and work on getting our team known through our website and by attending various UVic and community events. There are also plenty of opportunities to get some experience managing both small and large teams."
